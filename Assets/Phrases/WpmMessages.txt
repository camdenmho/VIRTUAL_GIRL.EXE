my stream was so fun today i got to interact with chat a lot
omg there was someone in my last stream who kept asking for feet pics
chat kept saying my mic was muted and i fell for it every time
someone donated ten dollars just to tell me to touch grass
have you heard of that one guy whose chat keeps asking him for elbow reveals
do you think i should commission a new model with the stream donations?
i cant believe my followers are already making fan art of me!
chat bullied me when i said my favorite pokemon is tepig
i think more people showed up last stream once i changed my model
i wonder if i would get more viewers if i wore cat ears...
im really liking the new model ive been using!
do you think i can buy another miku doll with the stream donations and use it as a tax write-off as a business expense?
i dont know how to feel about the chatters who constantly type weird things like "step on me"
if i play the horse game on stream is buying carrots for pulls considered a business expense
i think my stream was lagging today while playing, i should probaby upgrade my pc
do you think people would buy a plush doll or figurine of me?
i hope nobody i know in real life ever finds my twitter account
i love how supportive my dad is of my streaming, but he keeps yelling "are ya winning, son?" whenever he hears me
i unintentionally said 6-7 once and the entire chat lost it. what world are we living in?
i tried sending plushies to my apartment but the apartment and building field only accepted 12 characters and i needed 18
